    <h2>Not that ice cube</h2>
    <p>Ice Cube was born on June 15, 1969, in Los Angeles, to Doris, a hospital clerk and custodian, and Hosea Jackson, a machinist and UCLA groundskeeper</p>
    <p>But we're not here for that Ice cube</p>
    <p>"I'm publishing this recipe because I'm sure that there are other families who have members, who don't know how or have forgotten how to make ice when the ice tray is empty."</p>
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups water (approximately)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water (additional if needed)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Recipe instructions</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Empty the ice cubes that are left in the trays (if there are any left) into the bin.</li>
            <li>Take the trays over to the sink and fill them with cold water. (Hot water will freeze faster and more clear)</li>
            <li>Place the water filled ice trays back in the freezer.</li>
            <li>Replace the ice bin if you had to remove it.</li>
            <li>Shut the door to the freezer.</li>
            <li>Be sure to leave for around 4-6 hours at least to make sure it is frozen</li>
            <li>If you want to experiment, you can freeze things like fruit infused waters or juices.</li>            
        </ol>
